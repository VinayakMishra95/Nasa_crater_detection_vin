# Nasa_crater_detection_vin
Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims that are visible in orbital lunar imagery, helping advance future space exploration.
